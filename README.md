# lang

Functional interperted language.

Functions have no parse time optimisations!!!

Using main function is not recomended but works.

## Pretty lenient parsing (sometimes)

- Parenthesis are not required on function calls or if statements
- Indentation does not matter
- Only fatal errors
- Commas not required to split arguments
