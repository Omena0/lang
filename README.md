# lang

Functional interpreted language.

Functions have no parse time optimizations!!!

Using main function is recommended.

## Pretty lenient parsing (sometimes)

- Parenthesis are not required on function calls or if statements
- Indentation does not matter
- Only fatal errors
- Commas not required to split arguments

## Main features

- Functional
- Stateless (no globals)
- No loops (use recursion instead)
- No order of operations
- Easily expandable stdlib
- Python functions can be exposed
